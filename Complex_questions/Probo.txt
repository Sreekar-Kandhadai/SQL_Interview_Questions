1. We have a table which has 5 columns.  
   a. User_id, poll_id, poll_option_id, amount, created_dt  
   b. Users invest money on these different poll options - these entries are there in the table  
   c. One of the options is the outcome of the event.  
      **Event:** How many matches will the Indian cricket team win in 2022?  
      i. Less than 50  
      ii. 50-60  
      iii. 61-65  
      iv. Greater than 65  

   - India wins 63 matches in the end.  
   - **Option C is the winner**  
   - Money invested in options A, B, and D should be proportionately distributed amongst users who invested money in option C.  
   - **Example:**  
     - If the total money invested in options A, B, and D is Rs. 1500 and there are 3 users who invested 500 in option C {250, 200, 50},  
     - These users would receive (750, 600, 150) respectively - sum is 1500.  

   d. Write down a query for the above settlement process.
