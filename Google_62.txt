We want to identify the most suspicious claims in each state. We'll consider the top 5 percentile of claims with the highest fraud scores in each state as potentially fraudulent.

Your output should include the policy number, state, claim cost, and fraud score.

CREATE TABLE claims (policy_number VARCHAR(50), state VARCHAR(50), claim_cost FLOAT, fraud_score FLOAT);

INSERT INTO claims (policy_number, state, claim_cost, fraud_score) VALUES ('POL123', 'CA', 10000.00, 85.5), ('POL124', 'CA', 5000.00, 70.2), ('POL125', 'CA', 20000.00, 92.8),
('POL126', 'NY', 15000.00, 88.1), ('POL127', 'NY', 8000.00, 65.4), ('POL128', 'NY', 25000.00, 93.7), ('POL129', 'TX', 12000.00, 75.3), ('POL130', 'TX', 18000.00, 95.2),
('POL131', 'TX', 9000.00, 60.0), ('POL132', 'FL', 11000.00, 82.0), ('POL133', 'FL', 14000.00, 87.5), ('POL134', 'FL', 30000.00, 99.0);


Solution:


with cte as
(
select *, percent_rank() over(partition by state order by fraud_score) as per_rnk from claims
)

select policy_number,state,claim_cost,fraud_score from cte where per_rnk>=0.95

solution 2:

with cte as
(
select *, cume_dist() over(partition by state order by fraud_score) as per_rnk from claims
)

select policy_number,state,claim_cost,fraud_score,per_rnk from cte where per_rnk>=0.95 ;
