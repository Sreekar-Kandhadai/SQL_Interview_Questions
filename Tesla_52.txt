The company you are working for wants to anticipate their staffing needs by identifying their top two busiest times of the week.
To find this, each day should be segmented into differents parts using following criteria:

Morning: Before 12 p.m. (not inclusive)
Early afternoon: 12 -15 p.m.
Late afternoon: after 15 p.m. (not inclusive)

Your output should include the day and time of day combination for the two busiest times, i.e. the combinations with the most orders, along with the 
number of orders (e.g. top two results could be Friday Late afternoon with 12 orders and Sunday Morning with 10 orders). The company has also requested
that the day be displayed in text format (i.e. Monday).

Note: In the event of a tie in ranking, all results should be displayed.

Solution:

with cte as(
select dayname(timestamp) as day,case when time(timestamp) < '12:00:00' then 'Morning'  when time(timestamp) >= '12:00:00' and time(timestamp) <='15:00:00' 
then 'Early afternoon' when  time(timestamp) > '15:00:00' then 'Late afternoon' end as time_of_day,count(order_id) as order_cnt,
rank() over(order by count(order_id) desc) as rn from sales_log group by 1,2)
 
select * from cte where rn <3;
