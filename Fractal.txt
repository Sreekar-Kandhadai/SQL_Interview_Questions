The families of ancient greek gods were messy and you are given a database GreekGods that contains information about their families. 
Determine the mother and father of the various Greek Gods ordered alphabetically by the childâ€™s name


CREATE TABLE gods (
    g_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    g_name VARCHAR(50),
    g_gender CHAR(1)
);

CREATE TABLE relationship (
    c_id INT,
    p_id INT
);

INSERT INTO gods (g_id, g_name, g_gender) VALUES
(1, 'Zeus', 'M'),
(2, 'Ares', 'M'),
(3, 'Hera', 'F'),
(4, 'Persephone', 'F'),
(5, 'Demeter', 'F');

INSERT INTO relationship (c_id, p_id) VALUES
(2, 1),
(2, 3),
(4, 1),
(4, 5);

Solution:

select  child.g_name as child ,max(case when parent.g_gender='M'  then parent.g_name end) as Father,
max(case when parent.g_gender='F'  then parent.g_name end) as Mother from 
relationship a left join gods child on a.c_id=child.g_id left join gods parent on a.p_id=parent.g_id group by child.g_name
