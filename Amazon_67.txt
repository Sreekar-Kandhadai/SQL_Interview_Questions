formula (unitprice * quantity). Output the month, the description of the item along with the amount paid.

CREATE TABLE online_retails (country VARCHAR(10),customerid FLOAT,description VARCHAR(10),invoicedate DATETIME,invoiceno VARCHAR(10),quantity BIGINT,
stockcode VARCHAR(10),unitprice FLOAT);

INSERT INTO online_retails (country, customerid, description, invoicedate, invoiceno, quantity, stockcode, unitprice) 
VALUES ('USA', 12345, 'Product A', '2025-01-01 12:00:00', 'INV001', 5, 'A123', 10.50), ('UK', 67890, 'Product B', '2025-01-02 14:30:00', 'INV002', 2, 'B456', 20.75), 
('Canada', 11223, 'Product C', '2025-01-03 16:45:00', 'INV003', 10, 'C789', 15.00);

Solution:

WITH MonthlyAggregatedTotals AS (
    SELECT 
        MONTH (invoicedate) AS month,
        description,
        SUM(unitprice * quantity) AS total_amount
    FROM online_retails
    GROUP BY MONTH(invoicedate), description
),
RankedItems AS (
    SELECT 
        month,
        description,
        total_amount,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY total_amount DESC) AS rn
    FROM MonthlyAggregatedTotals
)

SELECT 
    month, 
    description, 
    total_amount
FROM RankedItems
WHERE rn = 1;
